    "As we learned yesterday, machines cannot intrepret raw text. We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n",

    "Processing text data to prepare it for maching learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a dataframe and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n",

    "To address the computational inefficiencies of the brute-force approach, a variety of tree-based data structures have been invented. In general, these structures attempt to reduce the required number of distance calculations by efficiently encoding aggregate distance information for the sample. The basic idea is that if point  is very distant from point , and point  is very close to point , then we know that points  and  are very distant, without having to explicitly calculate their distance. In this way, the computational cost of a nearest neighbors search can be reduced to  or better. This is a significant improvement over brute-force for large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the inefficiencies of KD Trees in higher dimensions, the ball tree data structure was developed. Where KD trees partition data along Cartesian axes, ball trees partition data in a series of nesting hyper-spheres. This makes tree construction more costly than that of the KD tree, but results in a data structure which can be very efficient on highly structured data, even in very high dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ball tree recursively divides the data into nodes defined by a centroid  and radius , such that each point in the node lies within the hyper-sphere defined by  and . The number of candidate points for a neighbor search is reduced through use of the triangle inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, a single distance calculation between a test point and the centroid is sufficient to determine a lower and upper bound on the distance to all points within the node. Because of the spherical geometry of the ball tree nodes, it can out-perform a KD-tree in high dimensions, though the actual performance is highly dependent on the structure of the training data. In scikit-learn, ball-tree-based neighbors searches are specified using the keyword algorithm = 'ball_tree', and are computed using the class sklearn.neighbors.BallTree. Alternatively, the user can work with the BallTree class directly."

It involves wearing a headset that creates a 360-degree simulation. The user is placed into a digital environment and he feels that he is actually there.\n",

    "VR headset technology is becoming accessible than before. It’s not just limited to gamers. TV watchers can get entertainment as well.\n",

    "Education and training are one of the most costly and dangerous exercises in the workplace. With VR technology, organizations can cut back on the costs and give their employees the best training without exposing them to risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Walmart has used 17,000 Oculus Go headsets for training its employees in the customer service department. Similarly, the U.S. Army has been using Microsoft HoloLens technology to offer soldiers real-time updates on their environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the limitations of Bag-of-Words approaches is that any information about the textual context surrounding that word is lost. This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n",

    "Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n",

    "In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the Distribution Hypothesis (Reference: Distribution Hypothesis Theory  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics. The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n",

Word2Vec can consider a larger context than only words that are immediately to the left and right of a given word, but we're going to keep our window of context small for this example.

    "#### Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of “context” or “neighboring” words is best described by considering a center word and a window of words around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we consider the sentence **“The speedy Porsche drove past the elegant Rolls-Royce”** and a window size of 2, we’d have the following pairs for the skip-gram model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text:**\n",
    "**The**\tspeedy\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n",
    "\n",

    "The **Skip-gram model** is going to output a probability distribution i.e. the probability of a word appearing in context given a center word and we are going to select the vector representation that maximizes the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams). Well, skip-grams go far beyond that and give our model much stronger contextual information.\n",

    "## Continuous Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "This model takes thes opposite approach from the skip-gram model in that it tries to predict a center word based on the neighboring words. In the case of the CBOW model, we input the context words within the window (such as “the”, “Proshe”, “drove”) and aim to predict the target or center word “speedy” (the input to the prediction pipeline is reversed as compared to the SkipGram model).\n",

    "## Notable Differences between Word Embedding methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) W2V focuses less document topic-modeling. You'll notice that the vectorizations don't really retain much information about the original document that the information came from. At least not in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) W2V can result in really large and complex vectorizations. In fact, you need Deep Neural Networks to train your Word2Vec models from scratch, but we can use helpful pretrained embeddings (thank you Google) to do really cool things!\n",
